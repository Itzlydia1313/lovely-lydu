## Summary

This project is my AI course submission where I share my story and my way of life. It includes exercises and examples I completed during the Building AI course by Reaktor and the University of Helsinki.
The course explained the different types of machine learning like supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. I also learned how AI systems are trained using data and how to check if they work well by looking at things like accuracy and precision.

One of the most interesting parts was learning how to design my own AI project. I didnâ€™t need to write real code, but I had to think like someone building an AI solution. The course also talked about how important it is to use AI in a fair and responsible way. It was a really fun and useful course, and it made me understand how AI is part of the world around us.
